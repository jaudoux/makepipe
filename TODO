# MAKEPIPE CORE
- [x] Each block should be represented as a single instance of a process, and the
      fact that an instance of a block is run with multiple inputs should be
      treated outside the score of the block
- [x] CRAC brick should be able to handle paired-end data
- [x] Change "summarize" key word, it is not very accurate
      We have choose "export" instead
- [x] Find a way to nicely handle multi-threaded jobs so they can be executed in a no-concurency mode since they already take more than 1 process to run
      - I have patched make in order to introduce a .SERIAL: special target that force target to be
      single threaded.
      However I have not found a dynamic way to place this PRAGMA only when the user wants to by
      specifying some kind of option in the YAML file
- [x] We should have a nice command-line tool that could gives the default parameters
      of each break and help the user to build its pipeline
- [x] Find a better way to describe dependencies between BRICKS in the YAML config file
      We should not use the Makefile variables, it shou
- [x] Simplify output Makefile :
      - [x] If rules or variables are equal between all iterations of a process, we could only use on definition!!!
      - [x] Use a variable as item id instead of a number
      - [ ] Could we do the same for rules???
- [x] Add a rule to all Makefile in order to first re-generate the makefile from the YAML file if it is more recent before running the pipeline
- [x] Allow the possibility to place directly shell commands in the YAML file instead of using
      a pre-defined brick
      - This could be done by introduction a brick call GENERIC that have three variables :
          - INPUT_FILE(s)
          - OUTOUT_FILE(s)
          - COMMAND
        And defines a simple rule that take an input file and produce an output file using a command.
        This should be generic enough to do a lot of things

- [ ] Tables should be defined as "list" in YAML template even if they are converted into string with space separated items in the Makefile
- [ ] Add a "filter" function to select a subset of items in a list that match a given value
- [ ] Add some kind of version ID to the pipeline in order to check prepare a new version comming of makepipe with a different syntax.
- [ ] Number of threads should be define in the "core" brick
- [ ] We should be able, not to specify output filenames to bricks
- [ ] Add documentation to the binary
- [ ] Create a specification format document for the YAML pipeline description
- [ ] Create developer documentation for construction Makefile bricks
- [ ] Find a way to cut the code in more pieces
- [ ] Add an option that tell where to find brick elements
- [ ] We should introduce some test cases for different purpose:
      - Verify retro-compatibility of the system
      - Verify that we can predict errors and not generate a corrupted Makefile
- [ ] Introduce clean rules that aggregate all cleans of process iterations into
      one single rule named with the process_name
- [ ] Write a Vim plugin for our YAML syntax to be highligten better
- [ ] Add a generic rule to remove empty directories
      Maybe we could recursively try to delete all directories?
- [ ] We could put bricks in sub-folder to have a sort of categorization for easier exploration
- [ ] All bricks should be able to declare some kind of version id of the software they use
- [ ] We should print a complete log file of the all pipeline that has been executed with dates, times, commands arguments and other cool things
- [ ] Place .SERIAL rule as an option for CRAC and CRACTOOLS_EXTRACT
      Maybe this could be automatically placed???
- [ ] Implement some kind of if/else statment in {{..}} syntax
- [ ] "Export" should not be placed in loop statement but at the same level?
- [ ] Add an option to "build" subcommand to tell makepipe if we should place the
      auto-regen rules in the generate Makefile or not
- [ ] Support Makefiles "import" commands


# NEW BRICKS
- [x] Generic brick (see before)
- [ ] Add a brick that generate rmarkdown reports
- [ ] Annovar brick
- [ ] Genome Simulator brick
- [ ] Create a brick to filter reads
- [ ] Create a generic brick to create symlinks
- [ ] Create a brick to rename files

# BUGS
- [ ] Print an error message if a {{..}} statement uses a variable that is not defined
