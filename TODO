- [x] Each block should be represented as a single instance of a process, and the
      fact that an instance of a block is run with multiple inputs should be
      treated outside the score of the block
- [x] CRAC brick should be able to handle paired-end data
- [ ] We should have a nice command-line tool that could gives the default parameters
      of each break and help the user to build its pipeline
- [ ] Find a better way to describe dependencies between BRICKS in the YAML config file
      We should not use the Makefile variables, it shou
- [x] Change "summarize" key word, it is not very accurate
- [ ] Find a way to nicely handle multi-threaded jobs so they can be executed in a no-concurency mode since they already take more than 1 process to run
- [ ] Tables should be defined as "list" in YAML template even if they are converted into string with space separated items in the Makefile
- [x] Simplify output Makefile :
      - If rules or variables are equal between all iterations of a process, we could only use on definition!!!
      - Use a variable as item id instead of a number
- [ ] Add a "filter" function to select a subset of items in a list that match a given value
- [ ] Add some kind of version ID to the pipeline in order to check prepare a new version comming of makepipe with a different syntax.
- [ ] Number of threads should be define in the "core" brick
- [ ] We should be able, not to specify output filenames to bricks
- [ ]
