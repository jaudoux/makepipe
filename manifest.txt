What we should do :

- Provide a strandard organisation of workflows
- Write workflows easily with a simple text editor
- Read workflows easily, even biologist
- Use pre-defined "blocks" in order to re-use a maximum of code among projects
- Re-run analysis on demand, only when needed
  - New software version "rerun in a separate folder"
  - Data have changed => Rerun only steps that are upstream of these data
- Easily share data with biologists
- Tracability : For each set of files that come from the same processing we need a log file,
  lets call it a "workstory" that describe what appenned to create the output and resume all
  steps that leed to the input data used to generate this step.
  Redondancy is no problem!!!
